  Toronto:

  With honest pride the rhymer sings
    Her ancestress’ renown,—
  Oh, proud the day that gave her birth!
    And proud her natal town!

  Oh, may the theme the verse redeem,
    Of meagre wit and rhyming loose,
  And win a kind indulgence still
    For Mary Susan Goose!


  Entered according to Act of the Parliament of Canada, in the year
  one thousand nine hundred, by WILLIAM BRIGGS, at the Department of
  Agriculture.

DEDICATION.


1.

  Though pure the drifting snows of northern realms,
    Dazzling the Aurora of the polar girth,
  More stainless still thy fair and childish brow,
    More bright the aureole that surrounds thy birth.


2.

  Ofttimes a nation bends its tender gaze
    To watch the blooming of a royal flower;
  Child of heroic blood, genius thy heritage!
    The loving interest of a world thy dower!

THE DEPARTURE.


1.

  Long years ago dear Mother Goose
    For little people made, you see,
  Of merry rhymes and odd conceits
    A veritable pot pourri.


2.

  Some riddles hard the brain to puzzle,
    Tales that really seemed quite true,
  Rhymes with fun just brimming o’er,
    For each one something à son goût.

[Illustration: a princess]


3.

  Her fame had spread through many lands,—
    A princess came from France to see
  The tree that bore the golden pear:
    At least such was l’on dit.


4.

  But years rolled by, the dame grew old,—
    Alas, the universal fate!
  She found herself almost forgot,
    And with her goose left tête à tête.

[Illustration: they plan the journey]


5.

  Said Mother Goose:  “My faithful bird,
    Our friends neglect us, to be sure;
  But never mind, we’ll just prepare
    And take a pleasant little tour.


6.

  Some evenings spent in brushing up
    The foreign words we used to know,
  Ere setting out upon our trip,
    Would now be very à propos.


7.

  I’ll order from my milliner
    A brand new hat and travelling suit;
  And then procure some maps and guides;
    We’ll surely need them whilst en route.


8.

  ’Tis fifty years since you and I
    Our journey took the moon to see;
  For fear we never should come back
    We left our cards with P. P. C.


9.

  What crowds there were to see us off!
    What merry shout and loud hurrah!
  Most certainly we undertook
    Our enterprise with great éclat.


10.

  And then the journey back again,
    And how we made the world to stare
  When home we brought the wondrous news—
    The moon was made of fromage vert!


11.

  But times are changed, and people now
    Doubt everything they cannot see;
  And men are old before they’re young,
    And even children feel ennui.


12.

  No fairies now their revels hold,
    Nor dare their merry pranks pursue;
  The prying eye, the searchlight’s glare,
    Have made them bid the land adieu.


13.

  Should you in this material age
    Your magic powers reveal by chance,
  You’d never be a moment free
    From scientific surveillance.


14.

  Besides, to ride upon your back
    Would outrage modern fashion’s code;
  To go upon a two-wheeled thing
    Is now considered à la mode.”


15.

  When thus the dame had spoke her mind,
    Her banker first she went to see;
  Then purchase made of many things,
    Besides a flask of eau-de-vie.


16.

  She meant to cross the Channel soon,
    And for the future had a care;—
  All those who travel on the sea
    Provision make for mal de mer.


17.

  Two bicycles were ordered then
    From Monsieur Brun de Chambray;
  To tell the truth, the dame on hers
    Looked really most distinguée.


18.

  The goose all unaccustomed was
    To this most curious gait,
  But spite of this her mistress vow’d
    She thought her manner was parfaite.


19.

  “I am an awkward creature,”
    Quoth the goose, “as people say;
  But on the water, rest assured,
    You’ll find me quite au fait.


20.

  “I know you dread the noisy ship,
    With all its bustle and to-do;
  And for the horrid smell of tar
    You have a natural dégoût.


21.

  “So let us take an open boat;
    The voyage is not very long.
  I’m sure we’ll reach the other side
    Without the slightest contre-temps.”


22.

  With courage rare the dame replied,
    “Your plan, I think, is for our weal;
  We’ll follow it without delay.”
    Her charming nature was facile.

[Illustration: at sea]


23.

  The noble, brave, and clever bird,
    As one may well perceive,
  For new and strange adventures now
    Was quite on the qui vive.


24.

  Adventures came too soon, alas!
    For on that self-same day
  A storm arose, and they were wrecked
    In that short traversée.


25.

  In this extremity most dire
    The dame takes off a wooden boot,
  And says, “I’ll buoy these precious bikes,
    And get them sometime coûte que coûte.”


26.

  For string she ravels out her hose,
    While briny waters saturate her;
  Her plan will surely win success
    For is it not a coup de maître!


27.

  “Now bind together, mistress dear,
    Before they float away,
  Those oars of good Canadian pine;
    They are our pis aller.


28.

  “Your weight, supported by this frame,
    I have the power to draw;
  Nor danger fear while you retain
    Such admirable sang-froid.”


29.

  By strength of will, and wing, and web,
    They reached a passing man-of-war,
  And now to Mother Goose and bird
    We must say “au revoir.”




[Illustration]


PUSSY CAT.


  “Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?”
  “I’ve been to London to see the Queen.”
  “Pussy cat, pussy cat, what saw you there?”
  “I saw a little mouse under the chair.”
  “Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you do?”
  “J’ai mangé la souris tout à coup.”




[Illustration]


HIGH DIDDLE-DIDDLE.


1.

  High diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
    The cow jumped over the moon.
  Regardez donc cette vache agile,
    Qui saute par-dessus la lune.


2.

  Je vais au marché à l’instant,
    I’m going to the market now,
  Pour acheter cette vache surprenante,
    To buy that remarkable cow.


3.

  The well-known cat and the wonderful cow,
    On the picture now you may see,
  Ainsi que le chien intelligent,
    Qui avait beaucoup ri.

[Illustration: page decoration]




[Illustration]


THE QUEENS OF THE CARDS.


  Les dames des cartes,
  Elles firent des tartes
  All on a summer’s day.

[Illustration]

  Les valets des cartes
  Volèrent ces tartes,
  And took them clean away.

[Illustration]

  Les rois des cartes
  Cherchèrent les tartes,
  And beat the knaves full sore.

[Illustration]

  Les valets des cartes
  Rapportèrent les tartes,
  And vow’d they’d steal no more.




[Illustration]


JACK AND JILL.


1.

  Jack and Jill went up the hill,
    Ensemble de l’eau y chercher;
  Jack fell down and broke his crown,
    La pauvre Jille fut renversée.


2.

  Up Jack got and home did trot,
    En colère et très-pressé;
  Dame Jill had the job to plaster his knob,
    Quand l’effusion de sang eut cessé.


3.

  Jill came in and she did grin,
    En voyant cet emplâtre;
  Her mother vow’d she’d whip her next,
    À cause de ce désastre.




[Illustration]


OLD KING COLE.


  Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
   Il aimait la compagnie;
  He called for his pipe, he called for his bowl,
   Singing “Vive la compagnie!”

  He shared with his fiddlers the very best cheer,
    Singing “Vive la compagnie!”
  He drank from his bowl the very best beer,
    Singing “Vive la compagnie!”

  He never knew sorrow, he never knew fear,
    Singing “Vive la compagnie!”
  He lived very happy (cela va sans dire),
    Singing “Vive la compagnie!”

[Illustration: page decoration]




[Illustration]


THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN.


1.

  There was an old woman
    Who lived in a shoe,
  Elle avait beaucoup d’enfants,
    And she didn’t know what to do.


2.

  She gave them some broth,
    Without any bread,
  Elle les battait très-fort,
    And sent them to bed.




Illustration]


BAA-BAA BLACK SHEEP.


  “Baa-baa black sheep,
    As-tu de la laine?”
  “Oui, Monsieur, j’en ai
    Deux poches pleines.

  “Une pour mon maître,
    Une pour ma dame,
  Rien pour le garçon
    Qui versa des larmes.”




[Illustration]


OLD MOTHER HUBBARD.


1.

  Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard
    Des os d’obtenir pour son chien,
  But when she got there, the cupboard was bare,
    Hélas! le pauvre chien n’eut rien.

[Illustration: chien mort]


2.

  She went to get bread
    From the baker next door,
  But when she returned
    Le chien était mort.


3.

  She went for a coffin,
    With many a tear,
  But the dog was only joking,
    Se met donc à rire.


4.

  She went for some tripe,
    Feeling all in a maze,
  But when she returned
    Il fumait à l’aise.


5.

  “I will get him some ale,”
    Mother Hubbard said she,
  But when she returned
    Le chien était assis.


6.

  She went for some wine,
    Her favorite to fête,
  Returning she found him
    Debout sur sa tête.


7.

  She went to the hatter’s
    To get him a hat,
  But when she returned
    Il nourrissait la chatte.


8.

  She went to the barber’s
    To buy him a wig,
  But when she returned
    Il dansait une gigue.


9.

  She went to the fruiterer’s
    To get him some fruit,
  Returning she found him
    Jouant de la flûte.


10.

  To buy him a coat
    She went to the tailor,
  Returning she found him
    À cheval sur une chèvre.

[Illustration: dog reads by the fire]


11.

  She went to buy shoes,
    But, most strange to tell,
  Returning, she found him
    Lisant les nouvelles.


12.

  To buy him some linen
    She went one fine day,
  Returning, she found
    Le chien qui filait.

[Illustration: dog fully dressed]


13.

  She went to buy hose
    From old Father Drew,
  Returning she found him
    Paré de son mieux.


14.

  The dame made a curtsey,
    The dog made a bow;
  The dame said, “Your servant,”
    Le chien dit, “Bow-wow.”


15.

  This wonderful dog
    To the dame was most dear,
  He could read, sing and dance,
    Et il savait écrire.


16.

  Whilst living she fed him
    With dainties galore,
  And built him a tombstone
    Quand il était mort.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO, MY PRETTY MAID?


  “Où vas-tu, ma belle chérie?”
  “I’m going a-milking, sir,” said she.
  “Puis-je t’accompagner, belle chérie?”
  “Just as you please, kind sir,” said she.
  “Que fait ton père, ma belle chérie?”
  “My father’s a farmer, sir,” said she.
  “Que fait ta mère, ma belle chérie?”
  “Wife to my father, sir,” said she.
  “Quelle est ta fortune, belle chérie?”
  “My face is my fortune, sir,” said she.
  “S’il en est ainsi, belle chérie—”
  “What do you mean, kind sir,” said she.
  “Nous n’aurons jamais de fiançailles.”
  “Nobody asked you, sir,” said she.




WHEN I WAS A BACHELOR


1.

  Quand j’étais un garçon,
    I lived by myself,
  Et toute la viande et le fromage
    I put upon a shelf.


2.

  Les rats et les souris
    Did lead me such a life,
  Je m’en allai à Londres
    To get myself a wife.


3.

  Les rues étant grandes,
    And the lanes being narrow,
  Je dus amener mon épouse,
    In a wheel-barrow.


4.

  La brouette se cassa,
    My wife got a fall,
  A terre fut la brouette,
    Little wife and all.




[Illustration]


HUMPETY DUMPETY.


  Humpety Dumpety sat on a wall;
  Humpety Dumpety had a great fall.
    All the King’s horses
      Et l’armée du roi
    Couldn’t make Humpety Dumpety
      Ce qu’il était autrefois.




TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN.


1.

  Taffy was a Welshman,
    Taffy was a thief,
  Taffy coura chez moi
    And stole a leg of beef.


2.

  I went to Taffy’s house,
    Taffy wasn’t at home,
  Taffy coura chez moi
    And stole a marrow bone.


3.

  I went to Taffy’s house,
    Taffy was in bed,
  Je pris vite le savouret,
    And beat him on the head.




[Illustration]


THREE WISE MEN OF ST. IVES.


1.

  Said this very wise man of St. Ives,
    “I hear that potatoes have eyes;
  I’ll shave all my head and dye my clothes red,
    I’ve a nervous objection to spies.”


2.

  Said the wiser, “I cannot advise
    Such a strange and uncommon disguise;
  But this is my plan, to eat all we can,
    Regardless of shape or of size.”


3.

  Said the sagest, “You don’t realize
    That your scheme is most truly unwise;
  If you eat them at all, either large ones or small,
    Every thought of your heart they’ll surmise.


4.

  “On the man who successfully tries,
    Or some feasible plan can devise,
  To grow us a kind that really is blind,
    We’ll bestow a magnificent prize.”

[Illustration: page decoration]




[Illustration]


THE FROG AND THE CROW.


[Illustration: musical score

   1. Une chère petite grenouille, Lived on the river brink, oh! Un
      corbeau noir et gaillard Came there to get a drink, oh! “Come
      ashore, Come ashore,” Dit le corbeau  à la grenouille, “Come
      ashore, come ashore,” Dit le corbeau à la grenouille.

  2. “And you shall hear the music On yonder green hill, oh! And you
      shall see the dancers All dressed up in yellow.” “Je vous
      remercie, Je vous remercie,” Dit la jeune petite grenouille,
      “Je vous remercie, Je vous remercie,” Dit la jeune petite
      grenouille.]


3.

  So the frog began a-jumping,
    A-jumping to land, oh!
  And the crow began a-hopping,
    To give her his hand, oh!
  “Je vous remercie, je vous remercie,”
    Dit encore la jeune grenouille.
  “Miss, you’re welcome; Miss, you’re welcome,”
    Dit le corbeau à la grenouille.


4.

  “But where is the music
    On yonder green hill, oh!
  And where are the dancers
    All dressed up in yellow—?”
                      “Yough” (scream).

[Illustration: crow swallows toad]

THE DONKEY’S REPLY.


1.

  “Dear Neddy, I called you long ago,
  Are you cold out here in the snow?
  I would take you down to the kitchen below,
  Only—”

                “Frottez le dos.”


2.

  “Cook is so cross I’m afraid to go;
  When I wanted to help her knead the dough
  She sent me away and scolded so,
  But—”

                “Frottez le dos.”


3.

  “But if you are quiet and speak very low,
  And try to walk on your very tip-toe,
  We might go to the room where sisters sew,
  Or—”

                “Frottez le dos.”


4.

  “Dear old Ned, you are as hoarse as a crow,
  And you wobble your long ears to and fro,
  But whatever you mean, I would like to know,
  By—”

                “Frottez le dos.”




FARMER BROWN.


[Illustration: artist at his easel]


  I painted a picture of his two cows,
    And sent him in the bill;
  Old Pogue is there, and Sukie, too,
    And Minn’s behind the hill.


1.

  Farmer Brown is a sneak,
    And Farmer Brown is a rogue!
  He said he would give me a pound, and he didn’t,
    For painting his cows and Pogue.


2.

  He wanted a picture of his two cows,
    Sukie and coal-black Minn;
  And then for the pound he was to give
    Old Pogue must be painted in.


3.

  Oh, Farmer Brown is a sneak,
    And Farmer Brown is a rogue!
  He said he would give me a pound, and he didn’t,
    For painting his cows and Pogue.


4.

  I painted a picture of his two cows,
    Sukie and coal-black Minn;
  And then for the pound he was to give,
    Old Pogue was painted in.


5.

  Oh, Farmer Brown is a sneak,
    And Farmer Brown is a rogue!
  He said he would give me a pound, and he didn’t,
    For painting his cows and Pogue.


6.

  I painted a picture of his two cows,
    And sent him in the bill;
  Old Pogue is there, and Sukie, too,
    And Minn’s behind the hill.


7.

  Oh, Farmer Brown is a sneak,
    And Farmer Brown is a rogue!
  He said he would give me a pound, and he didn’t,
    For painting his cows and Pogue.

THE CAPTAIN.


  “I’ve finished my ship to the very last nail,
  I’ve painted the deck and set the sail,
  And now I’m ready to cross the main,
  For I will be le capitaine.”




[Illustration]


THE SHOEMAKER.


  “I mean to make shoes of the strongest leather,
  That boys may go out in any weather.
  I’ve got some wax, and I know the way,
  So I will be le cordonnier.”




[Illustration]


THE COOK.


  “My cakes will be indeed a treat;
  I’ll make them of raisins and sugar sweet:
  First a story and then a layer,
  And I will be la cuisinière.”




[Illustration]


THE GROCER.


  “Currants and chocolate, apples as well,
  The very things I would like to sell;
  In spite of brother Ned’s facetiæ,
  I’ll be a prosperous épicier.”[A]

DICK’S POEM.


  When Benny wasn’t doing something silly he was very wise;
  He was bigger than he was small regarding size;
  His head was about as large as a piece of chalk,
  And when he didn’t run he went in a walk.
  Even when he walked it was on his feet,
  And he never was greedy when he hadn’t anything to eat.
  The way he didn’t behave himself was a disgrace;
  But then he never hurt you when he bit you on your false face.

L’ENFANT TERRIBLE.


1.

  I wish that grown-up gentlemen,
    And grown-up ladies, too,
  Would learn to speak as plainly
    As other people do.


2.

  Uncle calls me some queer name,
    Something “long” I know;
  I cannot tell quite what it is,—
    He always says it low.


3.

  I never call him “long,” although
    He’s seven or eight feet high,
  Or more, perhaps—at any rate,
    He’s longer far than I.


4.

  I tried to wait in uncle’s room
    To ask him what it meant,
  But all my poor dear dollies
    Wanted some of uncle’s scent.


5.

  They’re very fond of scent, you know,
    And so I gave them plenty;
  But, oh, dear me! I was surprised
    To find the bottle empty.


6.

  With sister it is just the same—
    She says I am de trop
  Whenever there is company,
    What’s that, I’d like to know?


7.

  To-day (of course to help them)
    I just took off the string
  From a cunning little parcel
    I saw the postman bring.


8.

  It was the sweetest ring, although
    It did not fit me quite,
  So I put it in my pocket
    To keep it out of sight.


9.

  My birthday cake was getting made
    Down stairs that very minute,
  And when cook looked the other way
    I pushed the ring down in it.


10.

  And if the ring should fall to Rose,
    I’ll be so glad, you know,
  For she is my darling sister
    And I really love her so.

THE APPLE-PIE PARTY.


[Illustration: ornate letters A B]

  A was an apple-pie, bitten by Tom;
  French people call an apple “une pomme.”

  B was the bite, and I really must say,
  Tom was sorry that ever he took “la bouchée.”

[Illustration ornate letters C D]

  C was the cook; Tom was always quite safe
  To get goodies and tarts, when he called him “le chéf.”

  D was the dinner got ready that day;
  Dinner in France is called “le dîner.”

[Illustration ornate letters E F]

  E was the edge (in France called “le bord”)
  Of that pie trimmed with pastry to imitate cord.

  F was the fun the sight gave to all;
  In words of the Frenchman “la gaiété folle.”

[Illustration ornate letter G]

  G was the guest Tom was late to receive;
  He came looking happy—a merry “convive.”

[Illustration ornate letter H]

  H was for Harry, who served the pie in great glee;
  In France his name is pronouncéd “Henri.”

[Illustration ornate letters I J]

  I was the ivy; the pie with great care
  Was entwined with the creeper the French call “lierre.”

  J was the juice, well sweetened by the cook;
  He flavoured it nicely and called it “le suc.”

[Illustration ornate letters K L]

  K was the kitchen, so tidy and clean;
  In France it is always called “la cuisine.”

  L was the linen beside each place set,
  In Anglo, the napkin; in French, “serviette.”

[Illustration ornate letters M N]

  M was the music (in French “la musique”)
  Aunt played for the game of “lost treasure seek.”

  N was the nurse (in France called “la bonne”)
  Who brought some small cousins to share in the fun.

[Illustration ornate letters O P]

  O was the oven (in French called “le four”);
  At ’Xmas it bakes many pies for the poor.

  P for the plates (in French “assiettes”),
  Kept warm till the table was all nicely set.

[Illustration ornate letters Q R]

  Q the quadrille, which I think came from France;
  The place where all children learn early to dance.

  R was the room where the dancing took place,
  In French called “le salon,” or else “la pièce.”

[Illustration ornate letters S T]

  S was the sideboard for things stored away;
  Cupboard, or sideboard, in French is “buffet.”

  T was the tray (in French called “plateau”)
  All laden with jellies and cream whipped like snow.

[Illustration ornate letters U V]

  U was the urchin, old cook’s “petite peste”;
  Of leavings and scraps she was always in quest.

  V was the valet; at “dix heures” he came,
  His very small master and mistress to claim.

[Illustration ornate letters W X]

  W a wrangler, a horrid “mégère”;
  Just read the next line, her name will be there.

  X Xantippe was not at the party, I’m told;
  Such people are always left out in the cold.

[Illustration ornate letters Y Z]

  Y was the year (in French called “l’année”),
  Which for these happy children had just passed away.

  Z was the “zeste” that appetites hearty
  Unfailingly give to an apple-pie party.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
